    <h2>Site Intent</h2>
    <p>I plan to redesign the website for the Christ Episcopal Church in Seattle, Washington. Information on the home page is very busy and all over the place. I plan to add and organize multiple pages so there will be less content on the home page. Website content will be organized in a way as to make the site more readable and user-friendly. Padding and margins will be utilized as well to make the site more readable. I would also like to give the site a more modern look. By adding a navigation bar and using multiple font sizes to differentiate title sections and bodies, traffic will increase. This will in turn, bring more people into the church.</p>
    <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
    <p>There are many Episcopal Churches in Seattle with multiple even being on the same street as the Christ Episcopal Church. Keywords that were used on competitor sites are as follows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> Episcopal churches</li>
      <li> Episcopal church prayer book</li>
      <li> pray</li>
    </ul>
    Traffic ranks are as follows:
    <ul>
      <li> Ststephens-seattle.org 17,635,955 in the last 3 months</li>
      <li> Stclementseattle.org 14,771,954 in the last 3 months</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Many competitor sites like, Saint Andrew’s Episcopal Church are a lot more organized and put together. This website has a navigation bar, logo, and one image as the focal point. The website that I am going to redesign currently does not have a navigation bar or logo. The Christ Episcopal Church website also has multiple photographs making it hard to focus.</p>
    <h2>Targeted Audience</h2>
    <p>Not many of the websites for Episcopal churches I found showed up on the Alexa webpage. I’m hoping that redesigning this website will generate more traffic and help the Christ Episcopal Church get a good target audience. I currently think that the target audience of this website are people of the Episcopalian faith. I think the second target audience group will be people who are searching for a church to call their home. </p>
    <p>I think that the group of audience who are already Episcopalian faith may already belong to this church. They will be coming to the website to find past sermons, get the schedule, and find out news. People who are not the Episcopalian faith may be browsing the web trying to find a church. They would come to this website to see what the sermons are like, find church location, learn about the staff, and see the church schedule.</p>
