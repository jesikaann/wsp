      <h1>S.H.A.R.E. NEWS</h1>
      <p>Christ Church hosts an indoor shelter for 30 men through Seattle Housing And Resource Effort [SHARE]. SHARE is still the most economical shelter offering in Seattle, but annually faces a budget shortfall.</p>
      <h2>S.H.A.R.E. joins WHEEL, Real Change and Nickelsville in the call to Occupy CEHKC, April 24-25</h2>
      <p>24-hours to change how Seattle sees homelessness</p>
      <p>Real Change, SHARE/WHEEL, and Nickelsville are calling upon the broader community to join us this April 24-25 in a 24-hour wake-up call to get real about ending homelessness AND meet the short term needs of those who suffer on the streets.</p>
      <p>Since the Committee to End Homelessness in King County (CEHKC) formed in 2005 the numbers of people in shelter during the one night count have gone up by 7 percent and the numbers of people found out on the street have risen by twenty-five percent. Homelessness is increasing because there are austerity budgets at all levels of governments for programs that serve the poor at the same time double digit unemployment continues and a predatory lending industry have created many new homeless, even as record numbers of foreclosed homes stand empty.</p>
      <p>April 24/25 is the launch of a long-term campaign to change how we approach homelessness in King County. Homeless people call upon CEHKC to revise how they operate, starting in these three areas:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Data collection and outcomes should be used as a tool, not a weapon. Data collection is being used as a tool for control of service providers and the enforcement of unrealistic priorities and outcomes. Programs that do not cooperate are threatened with funding loss.</li>
        <li>Provision of low-cost survival services must be prioritized. Shelter capacity should be pegged to demand and turn-aways should be tracked as a means of gauging need. Partnerships between tent cities and host communities should be nurtured to build the political will to end homelessness.</li>
        <li>CEHKC must create and promote an economic justice agenda.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>CEHKC leadership must use their influence to affect the issues that create homelessness, and not just mitigate the misery that comes from accepting injustice. These problems include inequality, affordable housing loss, scarcity of livable wage employment, and the criminalization of the poor.</p>
      <p>THE OCCUPATION BEGINS! Tuesday, April 24, Noon, Westlake Park. There will be blankets and tents, but you can also bring your own. You can also stay for part of the event, or come back for other parts.</p>
